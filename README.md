# SortDownloadFolder
This is a simple script which will put the files in your Download folder into appropriate subfolders depending on their file type.
It is just to organize things a bit better! Hope this helps anyone. If you wanted to use this more efficiently i would recomend using
windows task scheduler and running this once each day, so that you don't need to do this manually!
